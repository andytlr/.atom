Coffee-React\n\nCoffee-React provides a JSX-like syntax for building [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components with the full awesomeness of CoffeeScript.\n\nIncluded is the `cjsx` executable, which is wrapper for `coffee`, using\n[coffee-react-transform](https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react-transform) and\n[coffee-script](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript) to transform CJSX to Javascript.\nYou can also `require()` CJSX components under [node](http://nodejs.org) for server-side rendering.\n\n### Try it out\nThe [try coffee-react](http://jsdf.github.io/coffee-react-transform/) tool is available to test out some CJSX code and see the CoffeeScript it transforms into.\n\n### Example\n\nneat-component.cjsx\n```coffee\n# @cjsx React.DOM\n\nNeatComponent = React.createClass\n  render: ->\n    {showTitle, neat} = @props\n\n    <div className=\"neat-component\">\n      {<h1>A Component is I</h1> if showTitle}\n      Coffeescript really saves a lot of typing...\n      {<p>is this component neat?<br />{neat}x{times}</p> for times in [1..10]}\n    </div>\n```\n\ncompile it\n```bash\n$ cjsx -cb neat-component.cjsx\n```\n\nneat-component.js\n```js\n// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.7.1\nvar NeatComponent;\n\nNeatComponent = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    var neat, showTitle, times, _ref;\n    _ref = this.props, showTitle = _ref.showTitle, neat = _ref.neat;\n    return React.DOM.div({\n      \"className\": \"neat-component\"\n    }, (showTitle ? React.DOM.h1(null, \"A Component is I\") : void 0), \"Coffeescript really saves a lot of typing...\", (function() {\n      var _i, _results;\n      _results = [];\n      for (times = _i = 1; _i <= 10; times = ++_i) {\n        _results.push(React.DOM.p(null, \"is this component neat?\", React.DOM.br(null), neat, \"x\", times));\n      }\n      return _results;\n    })());\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Installation\n```bash\nnpm install -g coffee-react\n```\n### Usage\n\n```\n$ cjsx -h\n\nUsage: cjsx [options] path/to/script.cjsx -- [args]\n\nIf called without options, `cjsx` will run your script.\n\n  -b, --bare         compile without a top-level function wrapper\n  -c, --compile      compile to JavaScript and save as .js files\n  -e, --eval         pass a string from the command line as input\n  -h, --help         display this help message\n  -j, --join         concatenate the source CoffeeScript before compiling\n  -m, --map          generate source map and save as .map files\n  -n, --nodes        print out the parse tree that the parser produces\n      --nodejs       pass options directly to the \"node\" binary\n      --no-header    suppress the \"Generated by\" header\n  -o, --output       set the output directory for compiled JavaScript\n  -p, --print        print out the compiled JavaScript\n  -s, --stdio        listen for and compile scripts over stdio\n  -l, --literate     treat stdio as literate style coffee-script\n  -t, --tokens       print out the tokens that the lexer/rewriter produce\n  -v, --version      display the version number\n  -w, --watch        watch scripts for changes and rerun commands\n\n```\n\nOutput compiled JS to a file of the same name:\n```bash\n$ cjsx -c my-component.cjsx\n```\n\n#### Require .cjsx files under node\nAs with the `coffee-script` module, you need to register `.cjsx` with the module loader:\n```coffee\nrequire('coffee-react/register')\n\nComponent = require('./component.cjsx')\n\n```\n\n### Spread attributes\nA recent addition to JSX (and CJSX) is 'spread attributes' which allow merging an object of props into a component, eg:\n```coffee\nextraProps = color: 'red', speed: 'fast'\n<div color=\"blue\" {... extraProps} />\n```\nwhich is transformed to:\n```coffee\nextraProps = color: 'red', speed: 'fast'\nReact.DOM.div(Object.assign({\"color\": \"blue\"},  extraProps)\n```\nIf you use this syntax in your code, be sure to include a shim for `Object.assign` for browsers/environments which don't yet support it (basically all of them).\n[es6-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) and [object.assign](https://www.npmjs.org/package/object.assign) are two possible choices.\n\n### Related projects\n- [coffee-react-transform](https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react-transform), the underlying parser/transformer package.\n- [node-cjsx](https://github.com/SimonDegraeve/node-cjsx): `require` CJSX files on the server (also possible with [coffee-react/register](https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react)).\n- [coffee-reactify](https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-reactify): bundle CJSX files via [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), see also [cjsxify](https://github.com/SimonDegraeve/cjsxify).  \n- [react-coffee-quickstart](https://github.com/SimonDegraeve/react-coffee-quickstart): equivalent to [react-quickstart](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-quickstart).\n- [sprockets preprocessor](https://github.com/jsdf/sprockets-coffee-react): use CJSX with Rails/Sprockets\n- [ruby coffee-react gem](https://github.com/jsdf/ruby-coffee-react): transform CJSX to Coffeescript under Ruby\n- [vim plugin](https://github.com/mtscout6/vim-cjsx) for syntax highlighting\n- [sublime text package](https://github.com/reactjs/sublime-react/) for syntax highlighting\n- [mimosa plugin](https://github.com/mtscout6/mimosa-cjsx) for the mimosa build tool\n- [gulp plugin](https://github.com/mtscout6/gulp-cjsx) for the gulp build tool\n- [karma preprocessor](https://github.com/mtscout6/karma-cjsx-preprocessor) for karma test runner\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jsdf","email":"james@jsdf.co"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-01T01:01:05.349Z","created":"2014-04-05T04:46:05.570Z","0.0.1":"2014-04-05T04:46:05.570Z","0.0.2":"2014-04-05T04:48:13.839Z","0.0.3":"2014-04-07T13:24:41.846Z","0.0.5":"2014-04-18T08:52:31.197Z","0.0.6":"2014-05-17T10:45:05.950Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-23T15:00:02.586Z","0.1.1":"2014-06-07T05:39:24.021Z","0.4.0":"2014-06-30T12:44:18.093Z","0.5.0":"2014-08-01T01:01:05.349Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react","keywords":["coffeescript","react","jsx","cjsx","coffee-react"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react.git"},"author":{"name":"James Friend"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"BQLU0JHT84QMGLEA5M83SAHQA\""}
